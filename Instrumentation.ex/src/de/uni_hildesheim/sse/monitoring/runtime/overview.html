Do <b>not</b> call any method in the data gatherer before starting the Recorder. Even 
if this may work in an usual environment, it may fail in OSGi. Furthermore, 
<b>avoid</b> using the javassist special terms $sig, $type, $cflow and new inner 
classes as they require Javassist runtime support which, in turn, complicate 
using OSGi.
