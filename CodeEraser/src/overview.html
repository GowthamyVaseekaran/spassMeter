A simple byte code processor for subtractive product lines, i.e. for removing
annotated parts of byte code. Use 
{@link de.uni_hildesheim.sse.codeEraser.annotations.Variability} to annotate
your code with arbitrary ids and provide the enabled ids to the processor which
will modify the classes given in a JAR file and produce an output JAR file in 
which selected attributes, methods and classes are removed. See the ANT build
file for executing the tests.
