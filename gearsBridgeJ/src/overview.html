This project implements the platform independent frontend of Locutor, the SSE native 
library for querying system information, particularly the currently reachable WiFi 
access points.<br/>
The related native library is loaded automatically during class loading at first use.<br/>
Please note, that for proper use of this library, the main method of the using program must
terminate, i.e. <code>System.exit</code> during the runtime or 
<code>WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE</code> are not appropriate (use 
<code>WindowConstants.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE</code> instead).
