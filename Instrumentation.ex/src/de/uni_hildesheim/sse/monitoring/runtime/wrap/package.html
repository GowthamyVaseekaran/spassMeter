Contains wrapper and delegator classes. Delegating streams take an 
existing stream and wrap over the functionality for notifying the recorder. 
Instrumented streams need the same type of the stream to be instrumented and
are therefore defined as subclasses of system classes. Also these classes must
be available at JVM boot time!
